# v1.20.3

Version 1.20.3 of Medusa squashes a few bugs in the core, and updates an index on the customer table.

<DocCard item={{
  type: 'link',
  href: 'https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/releases/tag/v1.20.3',
  label: 'Release Notes',
  customProps: {
    iconName: "github",
    html: 'Check the release notes for all changes.',
  }
}} />

## Changes

### Customer table index

The multicolumn uniqueness index on the customer table (`email`, `has_account`) has been updated to only apply to rows where `deleted_at` is `null`. This is to allow for the creation of customers that were previously soft-deleted.

This change requires you to run migrations. See section below.

---

## How to Update

Run the following command in your Medusa backend:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @medusajs/medusa@1.20.3
```

To avoid unexpected issues with dependencies, it's also recommended to update all other Medusa plugins or packages you have installed.

## Actions Required

### Run Migrations

After updating your Medusa server and before running it, run the following command to run the latest migrations:

```bash
npx medusa migrations run
```
